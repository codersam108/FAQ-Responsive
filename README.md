# FAQ-Responsive
Hello Everyone!
Welcome to my repository!!
This repository contains code for a FAQs page for frontendmentor.io website.
The tech stack used in the following repository is- HTML,CSS and JQuery.
This project uses animations to make the scroll up and down in ease .
This project displays my skills in HTML, CSS and JQuery.
After completing this project , I got to know about-
1.Utilization of find() method in JQuery which helps us to select the descendants of an element.
2. Utilization of next() method in JQuery which helps us to select the next sibling of the element.
3. Revision of basic methods in Jquery for eg. .css() , .attr() etc.
4.Utilization of animations in JQuery
Overall making this project took me 2 days with daily dedication of upto 4 hours to this project.This project gave me knowledge about much broad aspects of using JQuery in a more constructive and efficient manner.
The resources i referred to while making the project is-
1. www.w3schools.com - website which is best and focuses on learn by practise methodology.
2. MDN Web docs-The official documentation by mozilla especially catered for developers.
3. Chatgpt.com-using AI recommendations , i was able to take hints in different parts of the program while making the project, although i ensured to use AI less so that I can make the project by myself by doing some hard work of looking into documentation instead of totally relying onto chatgpt for help and I was able to do so in the project.
Thanks for Viewing my Repository!!
